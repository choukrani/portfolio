### The Mathematics of Social Distancing

For my Health and Prevention-themed CPGE project (TIPE), I delved into mathematical modeling, leveraging powerful tools like numpy and matplotlib to create a robust solution. We focused on the numerical resolution of partial differential equations (PDEs) to address critical health-related scenarios, enhancing our skills in both mathematics and computer science.

- Proficiency in mathematical modeling techniques
- Advanced use of numpy for numerical computations
- Expertise in data visualization using matplotlib
- Problem-solving through numerical resolution of partial differential equations (PDEs)
- Integrating mathematical concepts into computer science applications
